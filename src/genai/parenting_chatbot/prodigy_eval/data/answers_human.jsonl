{"question": "How to change a nappy", "human": "When arriving home with your newborn, you’re thrown into motherhood, and there are many things to consider. With many conversations around the best nappies to use and how to use them correctly, how, and how often, do you change a nappy? Young babies may need changing as many as ten or twelve times a day, while older babies must be changed around six to eight times. If your baby's nappy is dirty, it’s best to use it to clean off most of the excrement from their bottom. Once this is done, use either the cotton wool and warm water or baby wipes to remove the rest and ensure your baby is clean. A top tip is to clean inside the folds of the skin. If you're using disposable nappies, try not to get any liquid on the sticky tabs, as they won't stick if you do. If you're using cloth nappies, carefully place them in a nappy liner and then fasten the nappy. The nappy then needs to be adjusted to fit around the waist and legs comfortably. We recommend using reusable nappies from birth if you’d like to reduce the impact you’re having on the environment and the number of times you change your baby."}
