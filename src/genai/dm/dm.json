        "description": "The development of children’s spoken language underpins all seven areas of learning and development. Children’s back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and cognitive development.\n\nThe number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and peers throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial. By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, practitioners will build children’s language effectively.\n\nReading frequently to children, and engaging them actively in stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems, and then providing them with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts, will give children the opportunity to thrive.\n\nThrough conversation, storytelling and role play, where children share their ideas with support and modelling from their teacher, and sensitive questioning that invites them to elaborate, children become comfortable using a rich range of vocabulary and language structures.",

When responding, expand on what has been said (for example, add a word). If a baby says “bottle”, you could say “milk bottle”. In a natural way, use the same word repeatedly in different contexts: “Look, a bottle of milk– oh, you’ve finished your bottle.” Adding a word while a toddler is playing gives them the model of an expanded phrase.

                    "Arrange resources inside and outdoors to encourage children’s independence and growing self-confidence. Treasure basket play allows babies who can sit up to choose what to play with. Store resources so that children can access them freely, without needing help.",
                    "Help children to feel emotionally safe with a key person and, gradually, with other members of staff. Show warmth and affection, combined with clear and appropriate boundaries and routines. Develop a spirit of friendly co-operation amongst children and adults.",
                    "Encourage children to express their feelings through words like ‘sad’, ‘upset’ or ‘angry’. Toddlers and young children may have periods of time when their favourite word is ‘no’ and when they want to carry out their wishes straight away. Maintain sensible routines and boundaries for children during these testing times. Negative or harsh responses can cause children to feel unduly anxious and emotionally vulnerable.",

                    "You cannot force a child to use the potty or toilet. You need to establish friendly co-operation with the child. That will help them take this important step. Children can generally control their bowels before their bladder.",

                    "Story times with props can engage children in a range of emotions. They can feel the family’s fear as the bear chases them at the end of ‘We’re Going on a Bear Hunt’. They can feel relief when the Gruffalo is scared away by the mouse.",
