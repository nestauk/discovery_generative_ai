# Examples of activities

You can use `scrape_activities.py` to collect examples of kids activities from the [Tiny Happy People website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/tiny-happy-people/activities/zjh8hbk).

The relevant urls were found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loK4_sCp35JRVM9z_xW8inF3eqb7pL-jEuFWuJ5fjNE/edit#gid=0)


## Usage

```
cd src/scraping

with the following columns:
- CONTENT: Title of the activity

- Age Range (if applicable): Age range of the activity
- Type: Type of the activity (there are 20+ different types used by BBC)
